# EulerProject
 My simple attempts at ProjectEuler puzzle problems.
 
 I am aware that some of this code is sort janky. In most cases I was not looking for a perfect solution but rather a workable one that ran in a reasonable time.
Furthermore, the code is often set up explicitly to solve the puzzle in questions and not built to be expanded or modulated easily. I can do those things and may even go for it sometimes, but generally speaking I'm just doing this for recreational purposes and thus I am not stiving for perfection.
